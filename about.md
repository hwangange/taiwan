First of all, thanks for checking out my blog!

I'm Angela, a high-schooler currently residing in Texas. I am of Chinese and Taiwanese descent, so do expect Mandarin phrases to pop up here and there in my blog posts. 

Taiwan Travels is based on my family's road trip around Taiwan during July 2015. I absolutely LOVE road trips, so you can guess why I wanted to blog our journey! I also wanted to try creating a website using Jekyll, a task that surprisingly requires very little coding. 

Thus, a blog was born. :D Enjoy.
