Some tips for all you noobs out there!

- Always bring a roll of toilet paper/tissues with you. There will be many occasions where restrooms don't provide toilet paper.
- If you're a student, bring your student ID. Many attractions offer student discounts!
- If you're a foreigner, keep your receipts to get a tax refund.
- Don't be afraid to haggle prices, especially at hotels.
- If you're in Taipei, definitely get an EasyCard (悠游卡). With an EasyCard, you can use the subway, rent public bicycles, and even make purchases at some corner shops.
- Always be cautious of your personal belongings, especially at subways and night markets.
- If you're going on a road trip like I did, prepare your CD's! Nothing beats a boring car ride like singing along with OneRepublic.
